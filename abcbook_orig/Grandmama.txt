THE CREED
I steadfastly believe in God,
The Father of all might;
Who made this world, and all
Theglorious world of light.
And I believe in Jesus Christ,
The everlasting Word;
The Almightly Father's only Son,
And our most gracious Lord.
Conceived by the Holy Ghost, and of
The Virgin Mary born;
By Pontius Pilate doomed to bear
Most bitter pains and scorn.
Was cricified, and for a time
Both dead and buried lay;
Descended into hell, and rose
To life on the third day.
Ascended up to Heaven; and there,
At God's right hand, is placed,
From whence he shall return to judge
The quick and dead, at last.
I likewise firmly do believe
A Holy Ghost in Thee;
The holy universal Church,
And saints' community.
Forgiveness of repented sins,
Through Christ, our sacrifice;
The resurrection of tghe dead,
And life that never dies,
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God whom we adore,
Be glory, as it waS, is now,
And shall be evermore.

LORD"S PRAYER
Our Father who in Heacven art.
Thy name be hallowed in each heart;
Thy kingdom come; may we fulfil,
Who dwell on earth, thy heavenly will,
With equal cheerfulness and love,
As saints and angels do above,
Give us this day our daily bread,
Us into no tempationlead,
But with thy grace preserve us still
From sin and everything that's ill,
For thine thekingdom and the power,
And glory are, for evermore.

To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God whomall the sacred host
Of saints and angels do adore,
All glory be; as heretofore,
It was, is now,and so shall be,
To ages of eternity.
