Munari
Bruno Munari is an Italian artist
who has been acclaimed as a
painter, sculptor, photographer,
designer of books, toys,
and mobiles. Interested in functional
design and the practical
application of modern art, he
has devoted his extraordinary
originality, his spontaneous
wit, and his delicate feeling for
form, space, and color to a
wide variety of activities ranging
from projection slides to a
fabulous fountain in his native
Milan.
His drawings and slides
have been exhibited in the
Museum of Modern Art in New
York City. Six of his picture
books — which one critic has
called “among the most original,
imaginative and beautiful
books ever made”—are available
in this country.
