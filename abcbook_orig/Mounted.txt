NURSERY RHYME ALPHABET.

KEY TO THE
NURSERY RHYME ALPHABET.
The child should be required to name the objects in this Alphabet, without seeing the Kay; which can be referred to, if necessary. By this means a knowledge of objects, and the amusement of using his own observations, will be obtained.

A a
A was an Angler,
Went out in a fog,
Who fished all the day,
And caught only a frog.

B b
B was cook Betty,
A-baking a pie,
With ten or twelve apples
All piled up on high.

C c
C was a Custard
In a glass dish,
With as much cinnamon
As you could wish.

D d
D was fat Dick,
Who did nothing but eat;
He would leave book and play
For a nice bit of meat.

E e
E is an Egg
In a basket with more,
Which Peggy will sell
For a shilling a score.

F f
F was a Fox,
So cunning and sly,
Who looks at the hen-roost,
I need not say why!

G g
G was a Greyhound,
As fleet as the wind;
In the race or the course
Left all others behind.

H h
H was a Heron,
Who lived near a pond;
Of gobbling the fishes
He was wondrously fond.

I I
I was the Ice
On which Billy would skate;
So up went his heels,
And down went his pate.

J j
J was Joe Jenkins,
Who played on the fiddle;
He began twenty tunes,
But left off in the middle.

K k
K was a Kitten,
Who jumped at a cork,
And learned to eat mice
Without plate, knife, or fork.

L l
L is a Lark,
Who sings us a song,
And wakes us betimes
Lest we sleep too long.

M m
M was Miss Molly,
Who turned in her toes,
And hung down her head
Till her knees touched her nose.

N n
N is a Nosegay
Sprinkled with dew,
Pulled in the morning,
And presented to you.

O o
O is an Owl,
Who looks wondrously wise;
But he’s watching a mouse
With his large round eyes.

P p
P is a Parrot,
With feathers like gold,
Who talks just as much,
And no more, than he’s told.

Q q
Q is the Queen
Who governs the land,
And sits on a throne
Very lofty and grand.

R r
R is a Raven,
Perched on an oak,
Who, with a gruff voice,
Cries, Croak, croak, croak!

S s
S is the Sheep,
Cropping grass on the lea:
Their owner has marked
On their backs a large D.

T t
T is a Trumpeter,
Blowing his horn,
Who tells us the news
As we rise in the morn.

U u
U is a Unicorn,
Who, as it is said,
Wears an ivory bodkin
On his forehead.

V v
V is a Vulture
Who eats a great deal,
Devouring a dog
Or a cat at a meal.

W w
W was a Watchman,
Who guarded the street,
Lest robbers or thieves
Good people should meet.

X x
X was King Xerxes,
Who, if you don’t know,
Reigned over Persia
A great while ago.

Y y
Y is a Yacht
Sailing far out to sea;
If you were on board,
How nice it would be!

Z z
Z is a Zebra,
Whom you’ve heard of before;
So here ends my rhyme
Till I find you some more.
