A
Agitated Aunts Alice and Ada and an abominably agile adder are accidentally abreast ascending an ancient archway at an Abbey.

Bumptious Brother Bob blissfully brags before bashful beauty; but bumble bees, buzzing by, banish Brother Bob's boasted but brittle bravery—Brother Bob bolts bawling behind bushes.

Feeble Fanny's foolish facile fainting fits frighten friends fearfully.

G
Genteelly garmented Grandma's goloshes gyrate grotesquely. Gymnastical gambols gratify Grandma.

Irish Ida is incorrigibly idle, incapable, indolent, impertinent—indeed impossible.

Nurse nursing nurselings. Nurse's nice nephew, Nathaniel Noggs' new nieces.

T
Tired Timothy thinking.

U
Uncle Uriah unfurls umbrellas unconventionally.

V
Vain Vivian's vibrating voice vexes.

Why will Winnie, writhing with wild whoops, wink wryly while working? Wearisome wilful Winnie! Whereas William's wonderfully worthy: William works well, without wandering, without wriggling—wise William!

Xenophon.

Y
Yellow Yeller.

Zack.
