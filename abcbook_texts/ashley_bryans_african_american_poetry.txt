Ashley Bryan's ABC
of African
American
POETRY

A
And God stepped out on space,
And he looked around and said:
I'm lonely —
I'll make me a world.
JAMES WELDON JOHNSON

B
Black girl black girl
lips as curved as cherries
full as grape bunches
sweet as blackberries
DUDLEY RANDALL

C
(Sojourner Truth)
Comes walking barefoot
out of slavery
ancestress
childless mother
following the stars
her mind a star
ROBERT HAYDEN

D
Dear Noah: Please save me a spot
Exposed to the sun, where the Mice are not;
But if I must share my chamber, the Ant
Is the one I should welcome. Yours: L. E. Phant
COUNTEE CULLEN

E
Each man
a string on the harp
doing its own destiny
no one pushing
no one behind
each man
the end
and the beginning
of harmony
HENRY DUMAS

F
There are words like Freedom
Sweet and wonderful to say.
On my heart-strings freedom sings
All day everyday.
LANGSTON HUGHES

G
God never planted a garden
But He placed a keeper there;
And the keeper ever razed the ground
And built a city where
God cannot walk at the eve of day.
Nor take the morning air.
ANNE SPENCER

H
Harriet Tubman didn’t take no stuff
Wasn’t scared of nothing neither
Didn't come in this world to be no slave
And wasn’t going to stay one either
ELOISE GREENFIELD

I
If I could imagine the shaping of Fate
I would think of blackmen
Handling the sun.
RAYMOND PATTERSON

J
July. The conspiracy of colors —
Ketchup, marshmallows, the tub of ice.
Bacon strips floating in pale soup.
The sun, like a dragon spreading its tail.
Burns the blue air to ribbons.
RITA DOVE

Why an alphabet book of African American poets? Simply as a way of presenting the work of many poets, poets who write for adults as well as children, in a form that both children and adults can enjoy. Though this is not an alphabet book in the traditional sense, it is an A to Z look at twenty-five poems and one African American spiritual selected by Ashley Bryan from a wide range of African American poets.
His selections are. for the most part, not complete poems, but fragments—samples that are complete in their own way, and that inspired him to create pictures that capture the essence of the poetry in another form. His marvelous paintings, in tempera and gouache, are his salute to the twenty-five poets whose works are included.
Well known for his storytelling, his picture books, his own poetry, and for his lectures on African American poetry, Ashley Bryan here gives readers of all ages a chance to share the joy he has experienced in the work of some of the poets he especially enjoys.

K
I am Kojo. In West Afrika Kojo
means Unconquerable. My parents
named me the seventh day from my birth
in Black spirit. Black faith, Black communion.
I am Kojo. I am A Black.
And I Capitalize my name.
Do not call me out of my name.
GWENDOLYN BROOKS

L
the Leaves believe
such letting go is love
such love is faith
such faith is grace
such grace is god
i agree with the leaves
LUCILLE CLIFTON

M
My grandmothers were strong.
They followed plows and bent to toil.
They moved through fields sowing seed.
They touched earth and grain grew.
They were full of sturdiness and singing.
My grandmothers were strong.
MARGARET WALKER

N
Nothing happens only once.
Nothing happens only here.
Every love that lies asleep
Wakes today another year.
OWEN DODSON

O
The Old of our people
are the elders of the race
and must be listened to,
must be looked after,
must be given meaningful work,
must be loved and cared for,
must be treated with highest respect,
the elders of the race
are the reason we are here.
HAKI MADHUBUTI

P
I’m Paula the cat
not thin nor fat
as happy as house cats can be
But now I've the urge
for my spirit to surge
and I shall go off
to sea
NIKKI GIOVANNI

Q
My hair, a hive of honey bees
Is a Queenly glory
Crackles like castanets
Hums like marimbas.
MAYA ANGELOU

R
Roll Jordan roll,
Roll Jordan roll,
I want to go to Heaven when I die
To hear old Jordan roll.
BLACK AMERICAN SPIRITUAL

S
To Satch
Sometimes I feel like I will never stop
Just go on forever
Till one fine mornin
I'm gonna reach up and grab me a handfulla stars
Swing out my long lean leg
And whip three hot strikes burnin down the heavens
And look over at God and say
How about that!
SAMUEL ALLEN

T
There is a heaven, for ever, day by day,
The upward longing of my soul doth tell me so.
There is a hell, I'm quite as sure; for pray,
If there were not, where would my neighbours go?
PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR



U
Calling black people
Calling all black people, man woman child
Wherever you are, calling you. Urgent, come in
Black People, come in, wherever you are, urgent, calling
you, calling all black people
calling all black people, come in, black people, come
on in.
IMAMU AMIRI BARAKA

V
Your Vividness grants color where
Great need is, in this dingy town.
As you in pride of rose and brown
Thread the dull thoroughfare.
STERLING BROWN

W
Who
can be born black
and not
sing
the wonder of it
the joy
the
challenge
Who
can be born
black
and not exult?
MARI EVANS

X
Without expectation
there is no end
to the shock of morning
or even a small summer.
AUDRE LORDE

Y
Young Neptune dashed the waters
Against enamel shore,
And kept the air a-tumbling
With bubble-clouds galore.
JAMES EMANUEL

Z
Night's brittle song, sliver-thin,
Shatters into a billion fragments
Of quiet shadows
At the blaring jazz
Of a morning sun.
FRANK MARSHALL DAVIS

Foreword
My ABC of African American poetry suggests a new way of working with the alphabet, not so much to teach the alphabet to the very young, but to introduce a world of poetry and art to all children. Generally alphabet books hold the first letter of whatever is presented. To do this alphabet book based on the first letter of the names of poets or from the first letter of the beginning word of a poem proved impossible.
There was also the problem of the length of poems. How could I have room enough for the illustration of a poem consisting of many stanzas or pages?
Then an idea opened this project to me. I'd use only the lines of each poem that inspired the image, and I'd capitalize the alphabet letter wherever it occurred in those lines.
I worked from a list of over seventy African American poets, drawn from my books at hand. I decided to include one African American spiritual, the root of Black song and poetry.
As I read, images sprang from the lines of the poets. I began sketching from the work of many more poets than one book would allow. Finally, I chose the sketches that offered a balanced play of images and did finished paintings from them in tempera paints and gouache colors.
You may find African American poets you know in this collection and others you might like to get to know. The acknowledgments list sources for all of the poems. Some poems are complete, others are fragments. I hope you will seek out the whole poems and go on to discover more work of these African American artists.
