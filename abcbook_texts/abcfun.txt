ABC FUN

A is for auto.
A wagon that goes
With only a push
From ten little toes.

B is for blocks
For houses you build
And when they fall down
Nobody is killed.

C is for cars
That run ofa a track,
And when they run off
They always get back.

D is for doll
A little girl owns.
It's body is stuffed
Without any bones.

E is for elephant,
Rubber at that
If you blow very hard
It gets big and fat.

F is for football
The big boys can tell
The fun you can have
If you know how to yell.

Julia's Verse.

G is for graphophones
Toy ones that say
The things that you tell them
The very next day.

H is for hobby-horse
Covered with hair.
Some you can ride
That rock like a chair.

I is for Indian Doll
dressed in leather,
With knife in its belt
And headdress of feather.

J is for jumping jack.
Just see it work!
It hangs on a string
And jumps when you jerk.

K is for kitchen.
All made of tin.
That's what the pans
And kettles hang in.

L is for lobster
That crawls on the ground.
When wound tight enough
It backs all around.

M is for marbles,
All shining and round.
A game that boys play
In a ring on the ground.

N is for Noah.
He built him an ark,
And opened a zoo
Like the one in the park.

O is for orange,
And that's just the size
Of the big rubber ball
I got as a prize.

P is for piano,
With black and white keys.
It's not very big,
But I play it with ease.

Q is for quiet,
And no boy is that
When he has a good game
With baseball and bat.

R is for roller.
A pretty tin toy
That shows all the colors
That please a small boy.

S is for "shoofly."
A seat and a throne
For wee little folk
Who can't stand alone.

T is for trunk.
Just open the lid
And see all the dresses
Within the trays hid.

U is for umbrella.
My doll has one, too.
In the rain, if she had none,
What would Dolly do?

V is for velocipede,
Boys like to ride.
It's more fun than walking.
Have you ever tried?

W wagonâ€”
To push and to pull
Both big ones and little,
And they're always full.

X is for xylophone,
Easy to play.
A hammer and metal
Make music all day.

Y is for yacht,
All ready to sail.
With canvas all spread
In a lake or a pail.

Z is for zebra.
It needn't be big.
In my Noah's ark
There's also a pig.
