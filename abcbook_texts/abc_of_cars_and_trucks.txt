ABC OF CARS AND TRUCKS
BY ANNE ALEXANDER PICTURES BY NINON

E is for EXPRESS CAR with buggies and bikes
and scooters and blackboards that everyone likes.

F is for FIRE ENGINE with hoses that spout.
See the men work to put fires out.

G is for GARBAGE TRUCK with sides of dark brown.
It hauls away rubbish from all over town.

H is for HOUSE TRAILER to hitch to your car
so you’re always at home wherever you are.

I is for ICE CREAM TRUCK with cool summer treats.

You hear its bell tinkle as it cruises the streets.

J is for JEEP, a small car with a squeak,
that scrambles up mountains or wades through a creek.

K is the KNIFE GRINDER’S truck with its bell.
It sharpens the knives—and scissors as well.

L is for LOGGER all loaded with trees
that lived in the forest. You build homes with these.

M is for MILK TRUCK that drives through the city
with milk for your breakfast and cream for the kitty.



N is for NEWS TRUCK with papers piled high
that tell stories of kings and saucers that fly.

O is for OMNIBUS that people can ride
when they want to go shopping. It’s cozy inside.

P is for POLICE CAR with sirens and light
to keep law and order from morning to night.

Q is for QUEEN’S float, the prettiest seen,
with flowers and banners and ALWAYS a queen.

R is for RACER. Just watch it whiz by.
As it zooms round the track it almost can fly.

S is for STREET SWEEPER with brush and with scraper.
It gathers the browned leaves and small scraps of paper.

T is for TRACTOR, a farmer’s good friend.
It plows up the ground from beginning to end.

U is for UTILITY TRUCK,
an all-around worker.
With pliers and wires,
it’s never a shirker.

V is for VAN for the circus in town.
It moves lions and monkeys -- and even the clown.


W is for WATER WAGON. It washes the street.
Jump out of its way or you’ll get wet feet.

X is for X-RAY TRUCK with its picture machine
taking X-rays of people so their bones can be seen.

Y is for YOUR CAR all shiny and new ^
with pedals and horn. Your friends like it too.

Z is the ZONE TRUCK with white paints and signs
so you can cross safely between the white lines.

A is for AUTO TRAILER, which, as you see,
packs a red car for you-- a green car for me.

B is for BULLDOZER, with a grumbling rumble
it levels the ground. Watch the rocks crumble.

C is for CEMENT MIXER. Hear how it grinds,
mixing the sand and rocks that it finds.

Tip up its back and watch the lumps roll.
