Simple text and life-like illustrations convey the wonder and beauty of the natural world in this unique book of ABCs.   [    abcs    ]: (F)
In A Bold Carnivore, each letter of the alphabet refers to a predator. Brief text explains where the predator lives, how it hunts, and the animals on which it preys. Both predator and prey are beautifully and accurately illustrated.   [illustrated ]: (G)
Author Consie Powell wrote her master’s thesis on the predator-prey concept in children’s literature and has spent a lifetime studying, drawing, and writing about the natural world. In this unique educational tool, she vividly recreates some of the critters and habitats she knows best to help teach young children both their ABCs and some of the natural relationships between various animals. To Powell, predators such as bats, coyotes, and weasels have gotten a bad rap. "They’re just bold and curious." And while the concept of predation makes some adults squirm, Powell knows children are generally fascinated by it.   [     it     ]: (H)
