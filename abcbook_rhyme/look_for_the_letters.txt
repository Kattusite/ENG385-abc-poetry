This la an ALPHABET BOOK. Of course you know Alphabet books. They have pictures which stand for the letters, one or more pictures for each letter from A to 2. That goes for this book too. But there'a something new besides.   [  besides   ]: (C)
First, there are not only pictures for the letter a word begins with, (as the "E" In Elephant or the "0" In Oeeae) but there are also pictures for the letter when it comes in tho middle of a word or at the end, as the *e" In Cherry or the "g" In Bug. We have to have those too, because otherwise Instead of a Cherry we would have a Chrry and Instead of a Bug we'd only have a Bu...   [     u      ]: (B)
There's another thing NEW In this book. The pictures don't Just stand for the letters. No, the letters are really in the pictures. They are pert of them. There is a real "E" In the picture of the Elephant and a real "g" In the picture of the Bug. You will find it when you look for it. It's always a Capital letter if the word starts with it (as tho "E" In Elephant) and a lower case letter if it is in the word or at tho end.   [    end     ]: (D)
Now perhaps you think that all you have to do is to read the sentence at the bottom of each page to find all the letters. But no, there are quite a few more letters hidden. In the Ostrich picture for Instance, can you sec the "o"s In the flowers on the ground? or the r s In the trees on the page where Ralph Is rowing his Rowboat? But I am not going to give myself away. You will have to find out for yourself.   [  yourself  ]: (E)
There's one moro thing. The loft hand pages all through tho book show how you can do these Plctures-wlth-the-letters-In-them yourself. It's quite easy. And you can use a colored pencil for the letter Itself and an ordinary black pencil for all the dots and lines which make up tho picture, like this:   [    this    ]: (F)

LOOK FOR THE LETTERS is an alphabet book — but an alphabet book such as an older generation never dreamt of. II. A. Rev. author-artist of the magic touch, has blown the dust from the dreary, plodding ABC’s of former days and has literally made them dance, with the result that the alphabet becomes one big twenty-six part game, the liveliest imaginable.   [ imaginable ]: (A)
There are pictures not only for the letter a word liegins with but also for the letter when it comes in the middle or at the end of a word, where it is. after all. just as impot* taut. And besides just having a picture stand for the letter, Mr. Key has hidden letters all through his pictures and then put it up to the young reader to hnd them. And be sides this, the left-hand pages of the book show how to draw these ’’Pictures-with-the-letters in-them." as Mr. Rey calls them, using a colored pencil for the letter and a black pen-cil for dots and lines which make up the picture.   [  picture   ]: (B)
By combining the qualities of a truly delightful picture^ame book with the very practical business of instilling twenty-six letters into young memories. Mr. Rey gives children a book which will be a very prized possession.   [ possession ]: (C)
