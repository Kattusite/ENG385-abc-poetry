A NOTE ABOUT THE ART                            [    art     ]: (A)
Tom Feelings prepares his art in several stages. He makes his first drawing and then transfers it onto a rough textured board in pencil, then goes over it with a pen filled with water-soluble black ink. This gives him his base art. Then he paints the areas   [   areas    ]: (B)
of the picture that will remain light or highlighted in the final painting with white water-based tempera paint. Next he lays a wet sheet of tissue paper over the complete board, which causes the black ink and the white tempera to run together, creating interesting shapes and forms. While the tissue is still wet, he paints ink   [    ink     ]: (C)
washes into the darker areas and more white tempera, sometimes mixed with ink,   [    ink     ]: (C)
into the lighter areas or over darker sections. Then the process of rewetting and   [    and     ]: (D)
painting into different sections continues until he feels he has captured the right   [   right    ]: (E)
mood. Finally linseed oil is used to accent some dark areas and bring out parts of   [     of     ]: (F)
the base line drawing.                          [  drawing   ]: (G)
The final effect is a picture so luminous and so subtle that conventional reproduction becomes impossible if it is to retain the essence of the original work. Although   [  although  ]: (H)
the art is prepared with only black ink, white tempera, and linseed oil, reproducing   [reproducing ]: (I)
it in only black and white maintains neither the strength nor the warmth of the   [    the     ]: (J)
original art.                                   [    art     ]: (A)
After many different tests were performed by the printer, a final decision was   [    was     ]: (K)
made: to photograph the art in what is called double-dot. Basically this is a technique   [ technique  ]: (L)
in which each piece of art is photographed twice. The first shot, which is called   [   called   ]: (M)
the key plate, includes all of the art and is printed in black ink. The second shot includes only portions of the art and is printed in a different color, in this case ochre (see color square below), which was decided upon after additional tests. The second   [   second   ]: (N)
color is not obvious in the final book, but has the effect of enriching the reproduction and maintaining the strength, subtlety, and warmth of the original art.   [    art     ]: (A)

introduction                                    [introduction]: (A)
The purpose of this book is to introduce the reader to Swahili words.   [   words    ]: (B)
Learning a language opens up many things to us. With new words come   [    come    ]: (C)
new ideas and an understanding of the people and environment which   [   which    ]: (D)
created the language.                           [  language  ]: (E)
Swahili is spoken across more of Africa than any other language. It   [     it     ]: (F)
is the language of about 45 million people in eastern Africa, in all or parts   [   parts    ]: (G)
of the countries of Kenya, Uganda, the People's Republic of the Congo   [   congo    ]: (H)
(Brazzaville). Zaire, Somalia, Tanzania, Rwanda. Burundi. Zambia,   [   zambia   ]: (I)
Malawi. Mozambique, and the Malagasy Republic. Swahili varies in dialect   [  dialect   ]: (J)
from one area to another: that spoken on the coast of East Africa from   [    from    ]: (C)
that of the interior, that of Uganda from the Congo and other countries.   [ countries  ]: (K)
In the same way, the Spanish language differs in dialect in the various   [  various   ]: (L)
provinces of Spain and in South America and the Caribbean Isles. But the   [    the     ]: (M)
important thing is that the peoples of the various East African countries   [ countries  ]: (K)
can make themselves understood to one another despite these small differences.   [differences ]: (N)
Because Swahili is spoken across such a vast area of the African   [  african   ]: (O)
continent, it could one day serve as the continental language.   [  language  ]: (E)
For purposes of simplicity I have referred to the language as Swahili,   [  swahili   ]: (P)
but properly called it is Kiswahili. The Ki prefix denotes the actual language   [  language  ]: (E)
as opposed to the people who speak the language.   [  language  ]: (E)
It should be noted that there are no Q or X sounds in Swahili; hence   [   hence    ]: (Q)
there are only twenty-four letters in the alphabet. The sound of the letter   [   letter   ]: (R)
G is hard as in give, and the R is like the Spanish R, made by rolling the   [    the     ]: (M)
tongue.                                         [   tongue   ]: (S)
There is a Swahili proverb that says: Haba na haba hujaza kibaba:   [    baba    ]: (T)
Little by little fills the measure. It is hoped that through this introduction   [introduction]: (A)
to Swahili, children of African ancestry will seek to learn more “little by   [     by     ]: (U)
little,” through available books, people, and travel.   [   travel   ]: (V)
