a pile of soft leaves and began to wonder what they should do.   [     do     ]: (45)
Pretty soon the moon came up—then Billy rubbed the   [    the     ]: (3)
Lamp and they had plenty to eat—and that made them feel   [    feel    ]: (32)
much-better and braver and more contented.      [ contented  ]: (46)
As they looked around, they saw two big, bright, shiny   [   shiny    ]: (47)
eyes staring at them — and they wondered if this was the   [    the     ]: (3)
same woods where Little lted Riding Hood met the terrible   [  terrible  ]: (48)
Wolf. So, not to take any chances, they quickly climbed   [  climbed   ]: (49)
into the branches of a big tree, safe away from the Wolves   [   wolves   ]: (50)
and Foxes and all the other wild animals that prowl around   [   around   ]: (8)

Who are you?                                    [    you     ]: (45)
Billy and Betty told them—and the wise old Owl winked   [   winked   ]: (53)
an eye and told them he thought they were very wise, too,   [    too     ]: (45)
to get up in the tree away from harm.           [    harm    ]: (54)
They stayed awake a long time, watching the Fairies and   [    and     ]: (23)
Elfins and Goblins that people the woods at night—then,   [    then    ]: (55)
like the Babes in the Woods, they grew very tired and fell   [    fell    ]: (56)
fast asleep—but they were up in the branches of the big   [    big     ]: (57)
tree, instead of being on the ground.           [   ground   ]: (8)
When the morning came, the sun was shining, the woods   [   woods    ]: (18)
were cool and sweet-smelling, and there were no wild ani-   [     ni     ]: (9)

Which all things should be.                     [     be     ]: (9)

So, Billy and Betty jumped down out of the tree—rubbed   [   rubbed   ]: (65)

lie wanted to see if the boys were neat—        [    neat    ]: (12)
And he wanted to see what they had to eat.      [    eat     ]: (12)
But he got there just as their food gave out—   [    out     ]: (74)
And a hungry boy—is a hungry scout!             [   scout    ]: (74)
He had only one can of Van Camp’s Soup—         [    soup    ]: (75)
And that wouldn’t get far with a Boy Scout troop!   [   troop    ]: (75)
So, he sat right down and he rubbed the Lamp.   [    lamp    ]: (14)
And they had enough food for a week in camp.    [    camp    ]: (14)
There were all kinds of good things—under one seal—   [    seal    ]: (32)
And it meant “Something Good for Every Meal.”   [    meal    ]: (32)
There was lots of spaghetti and pumpkin and beans.   [   beans    ]: (76)

ON one sunny day, with her hair all curls,      [   curls    ]: (80)
Betty went to the camp of the Camp Fire Girls.   [   girls    ]: (80)
Whenever she went on this kind of a tramp       [   tramp    ]: (14)
She always took with her the Wonderfid Lamp.    [    lamp    ]: (14)
For she knew she’d get hungry like all children do;   [     do     ]: (45)
So, she never went unprepared—neither should you.   [    you     ]: (45)
You must always have plenty of good things to eat,   [    eat     ]: (12)
If you want to grow strong from your head to your feet.   [    feet    ]: (12)
It was late afternoon when she got to the camp   [    camp    ]: (14)
And she saw right away she’d have need for the Lamp,   [    lamp    ]: (14)
For the Girls who had hoped to give Betty a treat   [   treat    ]: (12)

But Betty soon had them all smiling and gay—    [    gay     ]: (39)
* id the Camp Fire Girls well remember that day—   [    day     ]: (39)
For she rubbed on the Lamp, and a party was spread   [   spread   ]: (81)
That made each little girlie go happy to bed.   [    bed     ]: (81)

’way up in the sky by the Good Fairy, to visit   [   visit    ]: (86)
Little Sing-a-Ling and Ting-a-Ling.             [    ling    ]: (87)
These little fairy children live in the beautiful Crystal   [  crystal   ]: (88)
Palace of the Good Fairy—the wonderful Castle in the Air—   [    air     ]: (27)
but sometimes they come down into the world, to see good   [    good    ]: (31)
little girls and boys. And if you are very, very good, per-   [    per     ]: (4)
haps they’ll come down to see you\              [    you     ]: (45)
Billy and Betty were received at court by Sing-a-Ling   [    ling    ]: (87)
and Ting-a-Ling and they heard a fairy choir of a million   [  million   ]: (89)
little voices singing—                          [  singing   ]: (90)
Dear Sing-a-Ling and Ting-a-Ling,               [    ling    ]: (87)
Our King and Queen are you.                     [    you     ]: (45)
We love you, love you all the time              [    time    ]: (91)
For all the good you do.                        [     do     ]: (45)
Then the Good Fairy raised her star wand and walked   [   walked   ]: (92)
into the biggest and brightest crystal dining hall that ever   [    ever    ]: (93)
was seen. Sing-a-Ling and Ting-a-Ling—and Billy and   [    and     ]: (23)
Betty—and all the little fairies that live in this beautiful   [ beautiful  ]: (94)
Castle in the Air followed her; and they all sat down to the   [    the     ]: (3)
finest and most wonderful fairy party that ever was served   [   served   ]: (95)
in this beautiful Crystal Palace.               [   palace   ]: (96)
Billy and Betty showed Little Sing-a-Ling and Ting-a-   [     a      ]: (39)
Ling the Wonderful Lamp and told them all about it.   [     it     ]: (97)
They said—“If you will come back to the Earth with us, we   [     we     ]: (9)
will rub the Lamp when we get there and give you some of   [     of     ]: (16)
the best things to eat in all the World.”       [   world    ]: (98)
So, Sing-a-Ling and Ting-a-Ling were delighted and said   [    said    ]: (81)
they would go; and would take Billy and Betty back in their   [   their    ]: (27)
wonderful fairy Air Ship, if Billy and Betty would get   [    get     ]: (99)
married in the great big Castle in the Air.     [    air     ]: (27)
Then the Good Fairy said some magic words—and Billy Van and Betty   [   betty    ]: (20)
Camp became Billy and Betty Van Camp—and the four happy children   [  children  ]: (100)
jumped into the wonderful fairy Air Ship and started off.   [    off     ]: (101)
They traveled faster than Lightning—past the Stars and the Moon and   [    and     ]: (23)
through the Clouds—until they came in sight of the World, far below   [   below    ]: (102)
them. And they brought the Air Ship down at the edge of a beautiful   [ beautiful  ]: (94)
lake with lots of pretty sail boats on it.      [     it     ]: (97)
Just as they sat down—and as Billy lifted the Lamp to rub it—some-   [    some    ]: (37)
thing terrible happened! To know what that was, you must read the   [    the     ]: (3)

BILLY and Betty had promised Sing-a-Ling and Ting-   [    ting    ]: (87)
a-Ling a real, big treat of good things to eat.   [    eat     ]: (12)
But before Billy could rub the Lamp, a great, big.   [    big     ]: (57)
,bold Bad Robber jumped from behind a tree — took the   [    the     ]: (3)
Lamp away from Billy—and ran off with it into the woods!   [   woods    ]: (18)
The Bad Robber sat down on a big stone and rubbed the Lamp, in the   [    the     ]: (3)
hope that something good to eat would be brought to him. But as he had   [    had     ]: (104)
stolen the Lamp, it refused to work. So, he got very, very angry.   [   angry    ]: (105)
He threw the Lamp down on the ground and smashed it into a hundred   [  hundred   ]: (106)
pieces—and that was the end of the Wonderful Lamp!   [    lamp    ]: (14)
And it was the end of the Bold Bad Robber, too; for no sooner had he   [     he     ]: (9)
broken the Lamp than Aladdin appeared with a whole army of angry little   [   little   ]: (42)
Goblins. They bound the Bad Robber, hand and foot, and carried him off   [    off     ]: (101)
to a dark, dark dungeon—far down under the ground—and kept him there   [   there    ]: (27)
for the rest of his life!                       [    life    ]: (79)

WHILE Billy and Betty were telling Little Sing-a-   [     a      ]: (39)
Ling and Ting-a- Ling how very sorry they       [    they    ]: (39)
were—and all were wondering what they should    [   should   ]: (108)
do for something to eat—the Good Paiyy ap-      [     ap     ]: (9)
peared and told them not to worry. She said to Billy and   [    and     ]: (23)
Betty:                                          [   betty    ]: (20)
Now that you’re Billy and Betty Van Camp,       [    camp    ]: (14)
You’ll have no further need for the Wonderful Lamp.   [    lamp    ]: (14)
You won’t need the fairies—you won’t need the elves—   [   elves    ]: (109)

So, Billy and Betty said good-bye to the Good Fairy   [   fairy    ]: (107)
