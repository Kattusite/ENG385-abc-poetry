Foreword                                        [  foreword  ]: (A)
My ABC of African American poetry suggests a new way of working with the alphabet, not so much to teach the alphabet to the very young, but to introduce a world of poetry and art to all children. Generally alphabet books hold the first letter of whatever is presented. To do this alphabet book based on the first letter of the names of poets or from the first letter of the beginning word of a poem proved impossible.   [ impossible ]: (B)
There was also the problem of the length of poems. How could I have room enough for the illustration of a poem consisting of many stanzas or pages?   [   pages    ]: (C)
Then an idea opened this project to me. I'd use only the lines of each poem that inspired the image, and I'd capitalize the alphabet letter wherever it occurred in those lines.   [   lines    ]: (D)
I worked from a list of over seventy African American poets, drawn from my books at hand. I decided to include one African American spiritual, the root of Black song and poetry.   [   poetry   ]: (E)
As I read, images sprang from the lines of the poets. I began sketching from the work of many more poets than one book would allow. Finally, I chose the sketches that offered a balanced play of images and did finished paintings from them in tempera paints and gouache colors.   [   colors   ]: (F)
You may find African American poets you know in this collection and others you might like to get to know. The acknowledgments list sources for all of the poems. Some poems are complete, others are fragments. I hope you will seek out the whole poems and go on to discover more work of these African American artists.   [  artists   ]: (G)
