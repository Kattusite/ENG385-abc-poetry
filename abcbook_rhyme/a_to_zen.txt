ABOUT THIS BOOK                                 [    book    ]: (A)
Even before the first emperor of Japan began his reign in 660 B.C., Japanese   [  japanese  ]: (B)
culture was well established. Today, this ancient land is one of the most   [    most    ]: (C)
modern countries on Earth, and everywhere you can see the contrast between   [  between   ]: (D)
old and new.                                    [    new     ]: (E)
We considered hundreds of concepts, objects, and activities from every area of   [     of     ]: (F)
Japanese life before choosing the 22 topic words. Because the Japanese language   [  language  ]: (G)
has no sounds for the letters L, Q, V and X, there are no topics beginning with   [    with    ]: (H)
these letters. Japanese has only five vowel sounds: a as in ah, i as in machine,   [  machine   ]: (D)
u as in moon, e as in met, and o as in no.      [     no     ]: (I)
Yoshi's pictures were painted with dyes on silk cloth, using the same basic   [   basic    ]: (J)
techniques used to decorate kimonos. Like many other elements of Japanese   [  japanese  ]: (B)
culture, these techniques originated in China, and Yoshi studied them when   [    when    ]: (K)
she was an art student in Tokyo. She has modernized her techniques somewhat,   [  somewhat  ]: (L)
but the ancient traditions of the East remain.   [   remain   ]: (M)
Because this book is about an oriental country, we have given it an oriental   [  oriental  ]: (N)
structure. The pages go from back to front and right to left, like a traditional   [traditional ]: (O)
Japanese book. (Of course, Japanese people would say our books go from back   [    back    ]: (P)
to front.) On each page, the topic word is shown in Japanese the way they read,   [    read    ]: (Q)
starting at the top right corner and reading down. It is also shown in English   [  english   ]: (R)
the way we read, starting at the top left corner and reading to the right.   [   right    ]: (S)
We have tried to give you words and images to bring today's Japan closer.   [   closer   ]: (T)
Now perhaps your imagination will add the quiet tinkle of temple bells, the   [    the     ]: (U)
sweet taste of sushi, the cushion of tatami mats under your bare feet, the peace   [   peace    ]: (V)
of a Zen garden.                                [   garden   ]: (W)

Imagine that you know every move your           [    your    ]: (B)

your opponent pushing you. Don't push back, pull him toward you—   [    you     ]: (D)
he will fall forward and you will be in control! This is aikido: keeping   [  keeping   ]: (E)
your mind open to anticipate your opponent's moves, then using his   [    his     ]: (F)
own moves against him. Aikido comes from martial arts that are over   [    over    ]: (G)
1,000 years old and were practiced by highly trained warriors. Now it is   [     is     ]: (H)
practiced all over the world by ordinary men and women and even children.   [  children  ]: (I)

BUNRAKU                                         [  bunraku*  ]: (A)
A night at the bunraku puppet                   [   puppet   ]: (B)
theater is a dramatic trip back                 [    back    ]: (C)
in time. The puppets are half-life-size wooden dolls operated by three   [   three    ]: (D)
men: the master puppeteer moves the doll's head, eyelids, eyeballs,   [  eyeballs  ]: (E)
eyebrows, mouth, and right hand; a second moves only the left hand, and a   [     a      ]: (F)
third moves the feet. A chanter tells the story, playing all the parts. The stories   [  stories   ]: (G)
are so compelling and the puppeteers and chanter so skillful, that you forget   [   forget   ]: (H)
these are dolls and are soon caught up in their struggles to be honorable people.   [   people   ]: (I)

chanoyu, the tea ceremony,                      [  ceremony  ]: (C)
was performed only by Zen priests and samurai warriors, but now   [    now     ]: (D)
anyone can study it. Chanoyu often takes place in a small building apart   [   apart    ]: (E)
from the house, so it is a way to escape the problems of daily life. And   [    and     ]: (F)
chanoyu is so steeped in tradition— how the room is decorated, the artful   [   artful   ]: (G)
movements of the person who prepares and serves the tea, even how the dishes   [   dishes   ]: (H)
are cleaned and put away— that the ceremony is also a performance.   [performance ]: (I)

DARUMA                                          [  daruma*   ]: (A)
The next time you have a goal,                  [    goal    ]: (B)
perhaps to do well on a test, you               [    you     ]: (C)
may want to buy a daruma doll. They are made from papier-mache and   [    and     ]: (D)
come in many sizes, always without eyes. You paint in one of the eyes   [    eyes    ]: (E)
to indicate you have a goal. When you reach your goal, paint in the other   [   other    ]: (F)
eye. If you have another goal, you need a new daruma. The shape of the   [    the     ]: (G)
fat dolls comes from Bodai Daruma, the founder of Zen Buddhism in China,   [   china    ]: (H)
who is said to have meditated so long that he lost the use of his arms and legs.   [    legs    ]: (I)

Are you clever? Perhaps you were born in the year   [    year    ]: (A)
of the monkey. Eto is the Japanese zodiac, which   [   which    ]: (B)
originated in ancient China. It is based on 12 animals (rat, ox, tiger,   [   tiger    ]: (C)
hare, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and boar) and 5   [    five    ]: (D)
elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water) combined to create a cycle of 60   [    five    ]: (D)
years. Often arranged in a circle, they also indicate time and direction. The rat,   [    rat     ]: (E)
for instance, points north and stands for the two hours around midnight. Some   [    some    ]: (F)
people believe they take on characteristics of the animal of their birth year.   [    year    ]: (A)

of space must be used as efficiently as         [     as     ]: (C)

purposes such as living, dining, and sleeping. You sleep on a thick cotton   [   cotton   ]: (E)
pad or futon, which is folded up in the morning and stored in a closet   [   closet   ]: (F)

the genkan. To keep the tatami clean, when you come into the house   [   house    ]: (D)
leave your shoes in the genkan, but turn them toward the street so you   [    you     ]: (E)
can slip into them easily when you go out. The sliding panels are made of   [     of     ]: (F)
paper pasted on wooden frames and can be moved to make the rooms larger   [   larger   ]: (G)

people died in the explosion and even today some people suffer from diseases   [  diseases  ]: (F)
caused by the radiation. A Peace Park was created in Hiroshima and each   [    each    ]: (G)
