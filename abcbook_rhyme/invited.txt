* The art of spelling on the fingers has been dignified with the name of Dactylology. See the Abbe de 1'Epee's Method of educating the Deaf and Dumb. It will be proper to add, for the information of those   [   those    ]: (A)
who are unacquainted with this art, and         [    and     ]: (B)

A said to B. Come here to me.                   [     me     ]: (A)

In helping to enquire for E;                    [     e      ]: (A)
Then finding E, I fancy we                      [     we     ]: (A)
Shall not be long in getting G;                 [     g      ]: (A)
And though some say, H is no letter,*           [   letter   ]: (B)

Will, when we summon them, come on;             [     on     ]: (C)
And P his part will play anon;                  [    anon    ]: (C)
Q will not quarrel with our views,              [   views    ]: (D)
And R, I'm sure, will not refuse.               [   refuse   ]: (D)
S, it is true, is apt to hiss,                  [    hiss    ]: (E)
But will not take our scheme amiss;             [   amiss    ]: (E)
T will accompany us too,                        [    too     ]: (F)
And talk of it to Useful U;                     [     u      ]: (F)
Our visit V will no way Vex;                    [    vex     ]: (G)
W will welcome us; and X,                       [     x      ]: (G)
Though backward to begin, I know,               [    know    ]: (H)
Will still a good example show;                 [    show    ]: (H)
And thus, when all together met,                [    met     ]: (I)

NOTES.                                          [   notes    ]: (A)
* H, being only an aspiration, of breathing, is said, by some gramma-   [  gramma*   ]: (B)
rians, to be no letter. It is, indeed, no vowel, because unaccom-   [  unaccom*  ]: (C)
panied with voice ; neither does it, like a consonant, obstruct the free emission of the voice or breath;   [   breath   ]: (D)

S
S, from its sound, is called a sibilant, or hissing letter.   [   letter   ]: (A)
X does not begin any native English word.       [    word    ]: (B)

a
an association of ideas, which cannot fail to make the desired impressions in the most speedy and durable manner; and which, by   [     by     ]: (A)
connecting agreeable sensations with the first rudiments of learning, may have the most beneficial influence upon the studies of maturer years.   [   years    ]: (B)

b
but, as it takes a manifest station in the pronunciation of a syllable, instead of having a simultaneous utterance, like an accentual tone or inflexion, it has been thought convenient to give it a place in most alphabets, and to refer it to the class of consonants.   [ consonants ]: (A)

c
casions. The verses are rendered interesting, by the personification of the letters ; and, as children are very capable of relishing a witty point or allusion, it is conceived, that nothing of this nature, here attempted, will he found too refined for their comprehension, when properly explained by their teachers, for whose assistance a few   [    few     ]: (A)

g
gures are encompassed by labels, containing the letters, both great   [   great    ]: (A)
and small, in the five alphabets most in use : viz. Roman, Italic,   [   italic   ]: (B)
Old English, German-text, and Writing. The whole, it is presumed, will he found to comprise   [  comprise  ]: (C)

This expedient was suggested, by the mode in which deaf persons   [  persons   ]: (B)

ren, who often hold long conversations by means of it; and which   [   which    ]: (D)

w
who may wish to practise it, that, when a word is spelled, its conclusion is signified by snapping the fingers.   [  fingers   ]: (A)
