Two favorite authors present a panorama of our national heritage. “A is for America, the land we love” and B,—C,—D— and all the rest of the alphabet, represent those people, events, and attributes, that have made our country, and for which it stands. Finally ”Z” is for zeal”— the zeal that discovered America, that built it and that keeps it today. a land of liberty and freedom.   [  freedom   ]: (C)
Twenty-six beautiful full page illustrations in color face twenty-six dramatic stories of the American spirit. We read of Columbus and Washington and Lincoln,—of Freedom and Independence,—of Old Glory and our National Anthem, —of the Liberty Bell and of Valley Forge. Text and pictures together make a treasure house of America’s story.   [   story    ]: (D)
Here is a gay book but a serious one—a simple book but a book of great distinction. Here is a beautiful book planned first as a picture book for small children, but which will also interpret our country to newcomers from foreign lands, a book for every American whether he be five or fifty.

Once, long ago, this bell pealed out a message of   [     of     ]: (C)

The State House in Philadelphia later came to be   [     be     ]: (G)
called Independence Hall, and is still the home of   [     of     ]: (C)

disappear far out over the ocean’s edge, he said, "The   [    the     ]: (E)

that although India was a country to the east he   [     he     ]: (G)
could reach it by sailing to the west.          [    west    ]: (H)
But all the people laughed!                     [  laughed   ]: (I)
Columbus was so sure he was right that when he   [     he     ]: (G)
could get no help in his own country he went to   [     to     ]: (J)
Spain. The Spanish queen at last gave him three   [   three    ]: (G)

After many, many weeks the little sailing ships   [   ships    ]: (D)
reached the shores of a strange land where only red   [    red     ]: (L)

the wilderness. He made trails into unknown parts of   [     of     ]: (N)
the country.                                    [  country   ]: (B)
