Cawlomar and Goblick and Caro lesse were playing in the library when Mother came into the room. She said she wanted to write a letter to Father, and that the children must all go out into the stable to play, where they could make all the noise they wanted to. So Caw lomar put his toys carefully away on the top shelf. First, his box of building blocks, then his gas-ball and his funny wooden horse and the flannel elephant. Then all three went out quietly. When they got into the kitchen they found two loaves of chocolate cake Katy the cook had just baked. Goblick and Carolesse each picked a piece of frosting off and ate it, while Katy was not looking. Cawlomar went right back into the library and told his mother what they had done ! She was very sorry about it, but sorrier that Cawlomar should tell tales. “ You shall all three be punished for being so naughty,” she said. “ Goblick and Carolesse must stand in the corner for ten minutes for being so greedy, and Cawlomar must do the same for running and telling on them !

their hats and threw them over the fence. Finally, she threw a piece   [   piece    ]: (39)

First, you must know the names of the people in this picture. The lady on the sofa is Miss Curleykew. Fibius is standing beside her. You need not be afraid that the spiders on the sofa will crawl over him, for they are really only buttons.   [  buttons   ]: (A)
The old gentleman in the cane-chair is Grandfather, who has fallen asleep while reading “ David Grieve.” You can see the book on his lap. In the very front is Elostum. He looks very much troubled because he has lost his cap and can’t find it anywhere. When he came into the house he threw it on the floor. Teeza is behind him helping him look for it.   [     it     ]: (B)
You see. Miss Curleykew has been telling them a story, and when she finished, she told them that they might go out into the woodshed and see the little kittens that came that morning.   [  morning   ]: (C)
Elostum is very fond of animals and is in a great hurry, but he can’t find his cap. Fibius is laughing at him, for he knows where it is. It is on the floor, under Grandfather’s chair. You can just see one end of it.   [     it     ]: (B)
Miss Curleykew said, “ if you had hung it up properly, you’d know where it is ! Goops never put their things away!   [    away    ]: (D)
Are you a Goop? ”                               [    goop    ]: (E)

Fjbius and Lemeetri were out in the barnyard playing horse. Of course Lemeetri had to be the driver first, or he would n’t play. So he took Fibius’s whip, while Fibius ran with Lemeetri’s windmill. Then Fibius said, “let’s throw stones and see who can come nearest to that window in the barn without hitting it. Erlydyn came along just then, and she said,   [    said    ]: (A)
“you’d better not do it, for you may break the window-pane ! ” But the two Goops did try it, and after they had thrown a few stones, one that Fibius threw went right through the glass.   [   glass    ]: (B)
Miss Curleykew', who had been pruning a rose bush, came running up, when she heard the smash, and so did Cousin Billy, who had been raking the lawn. “Who broke that window?” said Cousin Billy.   [   billy    ]: (C)
Nobody answered. “ Did you, Lemeetri ? ” Lemeetri answered, “ no! ” “ Did you do it, Erlydyn ? ” Erlydyn said, “ no!” Cousin Billy turned to Fibius and said, “ did you do it, Fibius ? ” Fibius said, “ no, I did n’t do it, Lemeetri did it with a stone ! ”   [   stone    ]: (D)
Then Miss Curleykew, who had seen it all, said, “ O, Fibius, how can you tell such a fib ?   [    fib     ]: (E)

Obaynotte with them. These two little Goops quarrelled all the way   [    way     ]: (A)

Then, at last, when she tried to use the clubs Obaynotte laughed at   [     at     ]: (R)
her, and she lost her temper. “You are an old niblick, that’s what   [    what    ]: (S)

When Cousin Billy came round to where they were, he heard   [   heard    ]: (U)

“ Ma-ma! Come up and pull the clothes over me! ” After that had   [    had     ]: (73)
been done, she called out, “ Ma-ma ! Come and tell me a story ! ”   [   story    ]: (74)
The next time it was “ Ma-ma! When are you coming to bed ?”   [    bed     ]: (3)
Father was just telling how well he played the last hand, when   [    when    ]: (75)
Korlaway was heard again :                      [   again    ]: (56)
“ Ma-ma! Come kiss me ! ”                       [     me     ]: (19)
And Mother is saying, “no, I don’t want to kiss Goops to-night!   [   night    ]: (76)

Lazileva was the kind of Goop who would leave her tricycle   [  tricycle  ]: (80)
out on the sidewalk when she came in, because she was in too much   [    much    ]: (81)
of a hurry to put it away in the cellar; and by the time she went to   [     to     ]: (82)
look for it, it would be gone.                  [    gone    ]: (22)
This picture shows how Lazileva had all the furniture of her doll’s   [   doll's   ]: (83)
house broken. After luncheon she decided to clean house. So she   [    she     ]: (19)
took all the chairs and tables out of the bed-room and the dining-   [   dining   ]: (84)
room and the parlor of her house, and put them on the floor. Then   [    then    ]: (56)
she got a little whisk-broom from behind the bath-room door, and   [    and     ]: (51)
began to sweep the carpets of her little house. While she was wash-   [    wash    ]: (85)
ing the windows, Elostum came in and asked her to go out and   [    and     ]: (51)
play squat-tag with him and Gablia. So she went out and left her   [    her     ]: (50)
things all lying about on the floor.            [   floor    ]: (86)
While they were playing they saw the Minister coming to call.   [    call    ]: (69)
Mother called out the window for them to ask him into the sitting-   [  sitting   ]: (87)
room. You see what happened ! He did not see Lazileva’s furniture   [ furniture  ]: (88)

These Goops were invited to a party at          [     at     ]: (91)
Xcitabelle’s house one afternoon, and Messalina   [ messalina* ]: (92)
was so much in a hurry to go that she asked     [   asked    ]: (93)
to be dressed first. So she was dressed first, and   [    and     ]: (51)
her mother put some fresh flowers in            [     in     ]: (75)
her hat. The day before, Messalina              [ messalina* ]: (92)
had been out in the rain and the                [    the     ]: (43)
color had washed out of the flowers             [  flowers   ]: (94)
and stained her face so red and green           [   green    ]: (62)
that everybody called her a Goop.               [    goop    ]: (34)
When Messalina was dressed, she                 [    she     ]: (19)
took the old flowers .                          [  flowers   ]: (94)
and went out in the                             [    the     ]: (43)
garden to plant them.                           [    them    ]: (16)
She dug a hole in the                           [    the     ]: (43)
dirt with her wooden                            [   wooden   ]: (95)
spoon and stuck the                             [    the     ]: (43)
flowers into it, and                            [    and     ]: (51)
made such a mess that                           [    that    ]: (91)
soon her face and her                           [    her     ]: (50)
hands and her frock                             [   frock    ]: (96)
were very dirty.                                [   dirty    ]: (97)
So, when Ethel and                              [    and     ]: (51)
Mr. Jack came out                               [    out     ]: (98)
with Korlaway and                               [    and     ]: (51)
Yellkum to go to the                            [    the     ]: (43)
party, they found                               [   found    ]: (44)
Messalina had to be washed and dressed all      [    all     ]: (69)
over again ! Mr. Jack went on with Korla-       [   korla*   ]: (99)
way and Yellkum, while Ethel took Messalina     [ messalina* ]: (92)
back into the house.                            [   house    ]: (54)
Messalina had soiled her white slippers so      [     so     ]: (24)
badly that she had to wear her old black ones   [    ones    ]: (100)
to the party; and she got there too late to get   [    get     ]: (101)
any ice-cream. And she cried.                   [   cried    ]: (46)
“ It’s your own fault,” Ethel said to her,      [    her     ]: (50)
“ for if you had n’t made such a mess after     [   after    ]: (102)
you were dressed, you would have been on        [     on     ]: (22)

Hatesope disliked to take his bath so much that once he told Ethel he would strike her with his bat, if she got any soap in his eyes. I think he didn’t really mean it, but he thought it was funny to say it. But he put off his bath as long as he could, and always made a shocking fuss over it. It always took him a long time to undress and place his clothes on a chair, hoping that   [    that    ]: (A)
Ethel would let him off from his washing. He is in the tub now, and is screaming that he is cold and that there is soap in his eyes, and anything else he can think of. It is   [     is     ]: (B)
Elostum’s turn next, and he loves to take a bath, so he is all ready.   [   ready    ]: (C)
He has taken his coat off, and come into the bathroom in his trousers,   [  trousers  ]: (D)
and is laughing at Hatesope. Gablia is talking as usual, waiting for her turn to come.   [    come    ]: (E)
Ethel is hurrying as fast as she can, because she is going to the theatre with Mr. Jack, and she is saying, “ if you’d only not squirm,   [   squirm   ]: (F)
Hatesope, it would be over more quickly ! ”     [  quickly   ]: (G)
Gablia is saying, “ I’m going to bring in my little ducks and fishes and put them in the water with me, and I hope it will take Ethel four hours to wash me! ”   [     me     ]: (H)
Elostum is saying, “ Hatesope ought to have to eat a whole cake of soap to keep;   [    keep    ]: (I)
him from crying! Hatesope, why do you'          [   you'*    ]: (J)

Here you see Sister Ethel and Mr. Jack is with her, of course, for he comes to the house quite often. This time he brought a lovely book called “ The Confessions of a Minor Poet,” and Ethel laughed a great deal when she read it and looked at the pictures. Then Mr. Jack began to read his diary to her, and she forgot that there were any Goops in the room.   [    room    ]: (A)
But Abednego and Ugpert were there playing their “ doctor ”   [   doctor   ]: (B)
game. Abednego is the doctor, and when Ugpert comes in, he looks at her tongue and feels her pulse. But they would n’t let Inkfinga play, because when he holds Ugpert’s hand, he always leaves a dirty mark behind.   [   behind   ]: (C)
So Inkfinga put his bottle on the floor, and went up to the table and took the book that Mr. Jack had brought. He turned over all the pages and looked at all the pictures. Of course he left a smooch on each. He wiped his fingers on the lace curtains, and then tried to clean the marks off the book with his handkerchief, but he only made them worse.   [   worse    ]: (D)
Ethel was so angry that she did n’t know what to say. Mr. Jack knew what to say, but he did n’t dare to say it.   [     it     ]: (E)
“O, Inkfinga!” Ethel said, at last, “how could you touch that book without permission and ruin it ?   [     it     ]: (E)

It was a cloudy day when Mr.                    [     mr     ]: (A)
Jack called on Ethel, and, as they feared it might rain, they did not go out to walk, as they had intended, but stayed in the library. Mr.   [     mr     ]: (A)
Jack is showing Ethel a card trick, and she is trying to find out how it is done. When it began to sprinkle, the Goops came into the house and began to watch Mr. jack.   [    jack    ]: (B)
Askalotte, with her bell, is sitting by Ethel, but to-day she is behaving very well, and is quite still. Inkfinga has his bottle, as usual, and you can see how dirty his fingers are, but Ethel is so much interested in Mr. Jack that she does not notice how untidy that little Goop is, as he always behaves so nicely.   [   nicely   ]: (C)
When Dowanto came in, Ethel asked him to put his kite away in the closet, and he scowled and said, “ I don’t want to! ” When she told him to sit on a chair and watch Mr. Jack quietly, he said, “ I don’t want to ! ” When she said he must go up into the nursery, he cried and screamed, “ I don’t want to ! ”   [     to     ]: (D)
Dowanto has just found a card on the floor; Ethel is asking him to give it to Mr. Jack, and Dowanto is saying, “ I don’t want to ! ”   [     to     ]: (D)
Mr. Jack is very tired of hearing this ill-bred speech, but as he is very fond of Ethel, he does not say a word.   [    word    ]: (E)
It ended by Ethel’s having to stop and send I all the Goops upstairs. Askalotte and Inkfinga went laughing, but Dowanto stamped his foot on the floor and cried, “ I don’t want to go ! ”   [     go     ]: (F)
“ O, Dowanto ! ” Ethel said,                    [    said    ]: (G)

This is the way Abedbego acts when he is told to go to bed. He doubles up his fists, and says, "I won't!" Abednego and Haychu and Zeemsneaze were all out in the garden playing horse. Abednego's sister Ethel called to them to come into the house, for it was five o’clock. They all three ran in as fast as they could, for they thought that perhaps she had some candy for them. Zeemsneaze put his cap on the hall table, and his drum on the floor. They found that Mr. Jack, the young man who came so often to see Ethel, was in the drawing-room with her, and Henry, the butler, was just bringing in some tea and cakes for them. Abednego raised his hat very politely, and gave Ethel a pink he had picked in the garden. But when she told him it was time for him to go to bed, he threw his hat on the floor, and stamped his foot, and said, “ I won’t! ” But Haychu obeyed promptly, and you can see she is half-way upstairs already, calling to Zeemsneaze. Abednego would not stir, so Mr. Jack had to carry him upstairs, saying, “Some one told me that there were Goops in this house;   [   house    ]: (A)

did that they all began to                      [     to     ]: (20)
laugh. Miss Stilcum said,                       [    said    ]: (24)
“ now surely you know                           [    know    ]: (26)

This picture shows what a Goop Bawlfred could be, when he wanted to. He was out doors, playing with YVhymusty and Nibolene.   [ nibolene*  ]: (A)
Whymusty had on his soldier cap, and Nibolene was eating a doughnut as usual. After a while they heard a noise down the street, and saw an automobile coming along. It was Bawlfred’s Uncle Harry, and on the back seats were Ethel and Miss Stilcum of Wash-   [    wash    ]: (B)
ington, who was visiting at the house. They had been riding in the Park. Whymusty said, “ let’s race them ! ” and so the three children started running as fast as they could. Whymusty was ahead, and Nibolene’s hat had blown off, when Bawlfred stumbled and fell and hurt himself. But instead of getting up with a laugh, he began to cry!   [    cry     ]: (C)

But there is one thing that old Mr. Jack doesn’t like, and that is   [     is     ]: (8)
disobedience. He hates to hear children whine, and he hates to see   [    see     ]: (2)

First, Ethel told Whymusty that he must go upstairs and have his   [    his     ]: (16)

Then old Mr. Jack looked up over his glasses and shook his head.   [    head    ]: (18)
Next, Ethel told Whymusty that he was making so much noise   [   noise    ]: (19)

Whymusty said, “ why must I ? ” Old Mr. Jack shook his head again.   [   again    ]: (22)

When the Goops' mother told them that Mr. Jimmy Payson was coming to dinner, they all wanted to be at the table, because he always made them laugh. But Korlaway annoyed her mother so much, and Obaynotte was so naughty that they were not allowed to eat dinner with the company. Only Goblick was permitted to sit at the table, and when they began dinner, what do you think he did ?   [    did     ]: (A)
He licked his lingers, he licked his knife, you never saw such a sight in your life! He growled at the food, and he kicked at his chair, he wiped off his spoon and his fork on his hair ! He talked while he chewed, and he teased for more sauce, he took the best orange, and drank like a horse ! He played with the salt, and he played with his food, his eating was horribly, horribly rude ! He scraped at his plate, and he spilled all his soup, he sneezed and he coughed like the worst kind of Goop.

“ Goblick, leave the table instantly. I never saw you behave so badly ! ” You see Obaynotte and Erlydyn watching him on the stairs ?   [   stairs   ]: (C)

his memory was just like Jotantrum’s. Young Mr. Snale said they   [    they    ]: (13)
both were “ very unique.” Then they had tea and began to talk gubble   [  gubble*   ]: (14)

Then he began to pound on the piano with his shovel.   [   shovel   ]: (22)
Young Mr. Snale was so frightened that he nearly dropped his cup   [    cup     ]: (9)

Abednego and Badinskool behaved beautifully, even when the   [    the     ]: (34)
minister pointed his glasses at them and smiled, though they would   [   would    ]: (35)
much rather be out playing than telling how old they were, what they   [    they    ]: (13)

minister was talking to him, Zeemsneaze disgraced himself by wiping   [   wiping   ]: (36)
his nose on his sleeve. Ethel was shocked.      [  shocked   ]: (37)
The minister said, “ where is your handkerchief,   [handkerchief]: (38)

But when Askalotte came in she began to talk as fast   [    fast    ]: (47)
as she could. This is what she said: “ Eth-el, why are n’t you talk-   [    talk    ]: (48)

“Thumbkin says, ‘ I ’ll dance,’ ” Badinskool saw a bird on a tree. “ I   [     i      ]: (23)

Then the teacher took her from the circle and made her sit in her   [    her     ]: (72)

Afterward, when all the children were making mice out of clay,   [    clay    ]: (13)
Badinskool rolled up little balls of clay and threw them at Hatesope   [ hatesope*  ]: (74)

Erlydyn always wakes up early                   [   early    ]: (121)
in the morning and comes into                   [    into    ]: (40)
her Mother’s room and wakes her                 [    her     ]: (72)
up. No matter how tired or                      [     or     ]: (25)
sleepy poor Mother is, there is no              [     no     ]: (80)
more sleep for her after that.                  [    that    ]: (12)
This morning Erlydyn was worse                  [   worse    ]: (122)
than usual. She got up at five                  [    five    ]: (8)
o’clock and came in and jumped                  [   jumped   ]: (123)
on Mother’s bed. Then she                       [    she     ]: (46)
crawled into the bed and teased                 [   teased   ]: (124)
her Mother for a story. Then                    [    then    ]: (125)
she wanted to play that she was a               [     a      ]: (13)
kitten, and that her Mother was the mother cat. Then she wanted   [   wanted   ]: (126)
to be a little dog, and she crawled way down inside the bed-clothes   [  clothes   ]: (127)
and barked. Then she got out of bed and brought her woolly sheep   [   sheep    ]: (128)
and made it squeak “baa—baaa!” Then she wanted to play horse   [   horse    ]: (41)
with Mother, and use Mother’s braided hair for the reins.   [   reins    ]: (129)
Finally, Erlydyn got up and dressed herself; then, when she found   [   found    ]: (116)
her croquet mallet, she thought she would make believe that the   [    the     ]: (34)
balusters were a piano and play on them with the mallet.   [   mallet   ]: (130)
She is making a terrific noise, while Messalina and Nevershair, who   [    who     ]: (40)

Fijetta and Olwaynoy and Quarling are going to have their   [   their    ]: (50)
photographs taken by Cousin Billy. Mother has had a hard time   [    time    ]: (138)
with Quarling who has been quarrelling with Olwaynoy, and so now   [    now     ]: (139)
to punish him Mother has made him sit quietly in a chair until all   [    all     ]: (140)
three are ready. If he gets out of the chair or speaks once he will   [    will    ]: (44)
not have his photograph taken. Olwaynoy has behaved as badly, and   [    and     ]: (93)
now she is hiding Fijetta’s stockings.          [ stockings  ]: (141)
But Mother is having almost as bad a time with Fijetta, who   [    who     ]: (40)
simply will not keep still while she is being dressed. First, she kept   [    kept    ]: (142)
reaching for her heads which were on the bureau, and then she threw   [   threw    ]: (40)
them on the door, and began trying to get her hat. While Mother   [   mother   ]: (114)
was putting her shirt on she kept clapping her hands, and while   [   while    ]: (143)
Mother was trying to button it up, she jumped up and down. Nellie   [   nellie   ]: (144)
the nursemaid has just washed and ironed Fijetta’s frock and is ready   [   ready    ]: (145)
to put it on for her. Mother is almost out of patience with this little   [   little   ]: (86)
Goop, because she ddgets when she is being washed and combed and   [    and     ]: (93)
dressed every morning so that it always takes a long time to dress her.   [    her     ]: (72)
When Cousin Billy came in to find out what was delaying them,   [    them    ]: (146)
he said, “ Oh, I did n’t know I was going to make a Goop photo-   [   photo    ]: (147)
graph ! What’s the matter, Fijetta,             [  fijetta*  ]: (148)
