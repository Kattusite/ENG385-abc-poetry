Apple
Apple,
sweet apple,
what do you hide?
Wormy and
squirmy,
rotten inside.
Apple,
sweet apple,
so shiny and red,
taste it,
don’t waste it,
come and he fed.
Delicious,
malicious;
one bite and
you’re dead.

A
An icy stabbing so swiftly done,
the victim scarcely felt it.
The police are baffled:
"Where's the weapon?"
The sun shines down to melt it.
“Icicle” for I, “Mask" for M, “Trap” for T — these are only three of the twenty-six Halloween poems in this collection, one for each letter of the alphabet. Splendidly wrought in Eve Merriam's inimitable style, the poems are playful and shivery. Sometimes piercing, sometimes provocative, they arc always a surprise and a joy to read.
Lane Smith's spooky, alluring illustrations complement the poems perfectly. They, too, will startle and delight readers of all ages.

B
Bats in the belfry
lurk on high.
When midnight chimes,
shadows fly.
Umbrella wings,
beware, beware.
A silent swoop,
a cobwebby scare,
a rush in the darkness,
a brush against your hair.
Shiver and tremble
and don’t dare shriek;
the creatures can tell
if you’re faint or weak.
By dawn they’re back
in their dim dank lair
up in the rafters:
waiting, waiting there.

C
Crawler
Creepy crawlers
creepy crawlers
creepy crawlers clutchers
terrible feelers
horrible touchers
creeping in your hair
crawling on your skin
nobody knows
how they get in
creeping from the north
crawling from the south
creeping down your forehead
crawling in your mouth
creeping on your tongue
crawling down your throat
into your gizzard
where they float float float.

D
Demon
Diabolic demons
dance in the dell,
diabolic demons
cast their spell:
“Make this spot
infernally hot,
put your hate in,
Satan;
pass the pitchfork, please,
Mephistopheles;
Lucifer,
Beelzebub,
come when we call.
The devil,
the devil,
the devil
with it all!”

E
Little, littler, littlest sprite
laughs in secret, hides from sight;
can curdle milk, can tangle silk,
can guard from harm, can bring a charm.
Kind or wicked, true elves find
it all depends on humankind.

F
Fiend
A fiend with fiendish glee
is happy as can be,
mixing fiendish drinks,
stinking up the sinks,
unwinding all the clocks,
mismatching all the socks,
growing grass upon its head,
and never ever going to bed.

F
For Marian Reiner-E.M.
For Mom and Dad-L.S.

G
Ghost
More gruesome than any groan,
more dreadful than any moan,
most trembling, terrifying sight:
white silence in the dark of night.

H
House
Why do the curtains blow?
What do the floorboards know?
What is that splotch on the wall?
What is that clank in the hall?
Why does a sudden light appear,
and why does it suddenly disappear?

I
Icicle
An icy stabbing so swiftly done,
the victim scarcely felt it.
The police are baffled:
“Where’s the weapon?”
The sun shines down to melt it.

J
Jack-o'-lantern
Jack-o’-lantern,
jack-o’-lantern,
all aglow,
jack-o’-lantern,
jack-o’-lantern,
don’t you know
your head is hollow,
you’re missing teeth,
you’ve got no brains
and nothing underneath.
Jack-o’-lantern,
jack-o’-lantern,
squish squash squush,
when Halloween’s over
you’ll turn to mush.
Jack-o’-lantern,
jack-o’-lantern,
crybaby cry,
you’ll end up
in pumpkin pie.

K
“Follow me”
spells the key
that opens a gate
that leads to a wood
where a tower stands tall,
and the door of the tower
leads to a stair
that winds all the way
to the topmost floor
where a narrow hall
leads to a room
with a trunk inside,
and the lid of the trunk
springs open wide
to show a key
that spells “Follow me."

L
Lair
Lunging, plunging through the woods,
past the torchlight, past the fire,
loping, leaping, leading on
through the brambles, through the brier,
luring you into its lair.
Close your heart to what is there,
close your heart to what you learn,
or you may be taken in
and you may not return.

M
Mask
Guises, disguises,
all kinds of surprises:
A peasant’s a king,
a kings a knave,
a knave’s a donkey,
a donkeys a slave.
Conceal, conceal,
peel off and reveal
the mask that no one detects:
your face that the mirror reflects.

N
Nightmare
Nay nay nay
never get away
writhing writhing
in woe woe woe
too late to tell
friend from foe
closing in
for the kill
try to escape
chances are nil
nail you down
box you in a crate
stamp you null and void
seal your fate.

O
who did it
who?
Who spilled the beans
who broke the news
who stepped into
somebody's shoes?
who did it
who?
Who slipped the word
who hit a snag
who let the cat
out of the bag?
Who did the deed
who gets the blame
who is the culprit
What is your name?

P
A pet to pat, a pal of a pet,
a pet the family won’t forget,
a pet that pants and drools and yaps
and leaves a little spot in laps,
a pet that’s not the least bit vicious,
yet finds the neighbors quite nutritious.

Q
Question
Write it on the North Wind,
bury it in a wooden cask;
what is the question
that you dare not ask?

R
Rope
Twist the hemp
spin the flax
don’t fall into
the pavement cracks.
Bind fasten
entwine braid
step from the sunlight
into the shade.
Hoist the rope
keep it loose
hoist the rope
for what use:
to lift a sunken cargo?
or be a hangman's noose?

S
Skeleton
Clack clack clack
up the stair;
run to look—
no one’s there.
Clack clack clack
at the window panes:
merry pranksters
or grave remains!

T
Trap
Get a trap set a trap
trap trap trap
tap you slap you
try to wriggle free
coax you hoax you
snare take care
catch you latch you
never get free
hook you crook you
can’t catch me.

U
Umbrella
Umbrella, umbrella,
duck under, duck under;
the sky is a rage of
lightning and thunder!
More and more downpour,
deluging drenching,
abhorrent torrent,
no stopping sopping.
It’s raining pitchforks,
its raining cats and dogs
and loathsome toadsome
bulging bullfrogs.

V
Viper
Viper, viper,
spiteful sniper,
snake in the grass, lowdown, base,
smiling, smiling to your face,
virulent villain, venomous, vile,
darting poison with a snaky smile.

W
Witchery
Which, which,
which witchery?
Nectar of nightshade
or venom of bee?
Which, which,
which woeful bane?
Juice of the hemlock
or brimstone with rain?
Which, which,
which plaguey pox?
Soup bowls of toadstools
or mouse broth in crocks?
Which, which,
which should we choose?
Buckets of slimy
or barrels of ooze?
Which wicked wickedness,
which will we serve?
Well, which pretty poison
do you deserve?

X
Xylophone
Xylophone tones
xylophone bones
bones to clang
bones to bang
bones to bing
bones to bong:
Are they the bones
of old King Kong?

Y
Yeast
Stir it in the brew
stir it in the bread
rise rise
seethe spread
fuss fume
foam spume
spread and spread
and spread and spread
and spread and spread and spread.

Z
Zero
Round blank
Round blank
Only bubbles
mark where it sank.
What was the secret,
what was the prize?
Nothing but hollow
holes for eyes.
Where did it come from,
and where did it go?
No one alive
will ever know.
