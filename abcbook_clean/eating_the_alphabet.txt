It is difficult to find precise records of where
certain fruits and vegetables were first grown.
Long ago, as people traveled, they took along
their favorite fruits and vegetables and
exchanged them for other things, including
foods that were new and different. Christopher
Columbus, for example, brought corn to Europe
from his first voyage to the West Indies. Fruits
and vegetables spread to many areas of the
world, and today they are grown across the
globe and quickly shipped to markets in
faraway places. That is why you don't always have
to wait for a certain growing season to find your
favorites. You can eat strawberries while you
watch snowflakes falling outside your window.
And someone, somewhere, is probably growing
fruits and vegetables for you right now - so you
can eat the alphabet any time.
