 

A
A for Ark, a funny boat;
Nothing like it now afloat.
Birds and beasts, and repiles too,
Form the passengers and crew.

B
B for Bears, both great and small,
Polars, Grizzlies, Black ones, all;
Fur so thick and warm they wear
That for cold they do not care.

C
C for Cats of every shade;
From them fiddle strings are made.
When Puss watches in the night
Rats must seek their holes in fright.

D
D for Donkey, Jack's his name,
Sometimes wild and sometimes tame;
Small in tail but large in ear,
And his voice is very queer.

E
E for Elephant, who grows
Such a very funny nose.
When he's hot and feeling queer,
He fans his face with his big ear.

F
F for Fox, a creature sly;
Hens should tremble when he's nigh,
For he's cunning as can be-
Few can catch fore fowls than he

G
G for Goat, on strange things reared,
And he wears a long thin beard;
But be careful of his horn,
Or your clothes may soon be torn.

H
H for Hog an ugly thing,
Nasty food to him they bring,
And before he eats he wallows,
Grunting as he quickly swallows.

I
I for Insects, curious things,
With numerous legs and gauzy wings
Some are pleased to show their skill
In making music loud and shrill.

J
J for Jackal, who sweeps the floors,
And does a lot of other chores,
While the mermaids wash the dishes,
(These maids you know, are half like fishes.)

K
K stands for the Kangaroo;
Queer are many things she'll do:
She keeps her babies in a pouch -
Now she'll leap, and now she'll crouch.

L
L for Lion, brown and yellow,
Quite a fierce and roaring fellow.
When his mouth he opens wide
You will see great teeth inside.

M
M for Monkeys, if you please,
Their tails are long , they live in trees;
How they chatter how they grin,
And how silky fine their skin!

N
N for Noah, owner he
Of this great menagerie,
And captain of the mighty boat
That kept the whole vast crowd afloat.

ABC AND PICTURE BOOK

O
O for Owl, the wisest bird,
Nightly is his queer hoot heard
By the man inside the moon,
Bu the sun will stop him soon.

P
P for Pheasant a brilliant sight,
In his coat of feathers bright,
Tinted yellow, green, and red,
With flowing tail and crested head.

Q
Q for Quail, a neat brown bird,
In the grass his note is heard;
Quaint and piping is its voice,
And its flesh is very choice.

R
R for Rabbit, watchful, sly,
And in its movements quick and spry.
With its erect and lengthy ears,
Approaching foes it quickly hears.

S
S for Squirrel: 'mid the trees
It climbs and springs with graceful ease.
A store of nuts aways it lays
To last it through the winter days.

T
T for Tiger - keep away!
For it eats a man a day;
And it's often heard to roar
When it wants a little more.

NOAH'S ARK ABC

U
U for Umbrella Bird, that's seen
Amid Brazilian forests green.
A tuft of feathers which it wears
Obtains for it the name it bears.

V
V for Vicuna, who lives high
On peaks well up toward the sky.
Do you imagine that he knows
His wool is used to make fine clothes?

W
W for the big, big Whale;
How he swings he monstrous tail!
When he rushes at a boat
It is hard to keep afloat.

X
X is in eXit - Noah's band
Were glad, no doubt, to get on land,
Where they could stretch their limbs and necks
More freely than between the decks.

Y
Y for Yak, with silky locks;
A near relation of the ox.
In central Asia it draws the plow,
And serves the purpose of a cow.

Z
Z for Zebra, with his hide
Gayly striped all down the side.
He can travel with great speed,
But is very shy indeed.
