Come here, my boy, and tell me, pray,
Is not this just like an A ?

B
Spur-red and boot-ed, quite a Dan-dy,
See, he makes great B, for bran-dy.

C
It makes one laugh a man to see,
Bend his bo-dy like a C.

Hold-ing fast by ei-ther show,
Well e-nough for D will do.

E
With his glass, quite full of glee,
See him sit, in shape like E.

F
With emp-ty hot-tie, once so jol-ly,
See him stand like F, for fol-ly.

G
If you could bend as well as he,
You would al-so make a G.

H
Hold-ing by each o-ther’s hand,
Like an H this cou-ple stand.

H
He holds his arms, his legs, and head,
As if he wish’d to make a Z.

I
You need not cock your head so high,
To make your-self look like an I.

K
March-ing bold-ly on his way,
He looks just like the let-ter K.

L
Now, if the truth is man could tell,
He'd say, "Am I not like an L?"

M
If you could place your-self like this,
You'd make an M, that stands for miss.

N
Sit thus, my lit-tie boy, and then
We’ll say you look just like an N.

O
If you could bend your bo-dy so,
You would make a great round O.

P
He pulls his cap, and then you see
How much he looks like let-ter P.

Q
This man he laughs, and so would you,
If you could make so a good a Q.

R
Danc-ing with his mug or jar,
He lit-tle thinks how like an R.

S
Bend your legs and arms, then guess,
Whe-ther you would make an S.

T
Do but, do but, come and see,
How much this man looks like a T.

U
Lean back, raise legs, then you will be,
For all the world just like a V.

W
Bend-ing so might ra-ther trou-ble you,
Yet, two so bent will make a W.

X
Some-thing must this cou-ple vex,
They stand so much like let-ter X.

Y
Head straight down, and feet up high,
Stretch’d wide as any let-ter Y.
