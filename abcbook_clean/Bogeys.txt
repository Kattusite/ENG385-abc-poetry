*NOTE - The fact is this tiresome Bogey ought not to have been included in this Portrait
Gallery; but like a good many other bores who know as much about music as a dust-pan,
he had to be included in the party for fear of offending his vanity. - (A.L.)

T
THE 'Xtraord'nary Bogey reclines on his back,
And warbles sweet tunes with a marvelous knack.
He twirls on his tail an immense tamborine:
You might think he was old, but he's only nineteen.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
But truly he's only nineteen!
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
But truly he's only nineteen!

T
THE ALPHABET OF MUSICAL BOGEYS
Written and Illustrated
ARTHUR LAYARD
With Music by
EMIL SAUER

T
THE Audible Bogey in place of a nose,
Has a Trumpet on which lie unceasingly blows.
He carries his music in front in a bag,
And the end of his tail has a musical wag.
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
His tail has a musical wag!

T
THE Clarion Bogey lias only one lung;
Be that as it may, he leaves nothing unsung;
And the blast is so great, so unspeakably strong—
When he blares out behind him, it drives him along.
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ' Hoo !—Hee !
Hee He blares,—and it drives him along !
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee !
Hee He blares,—and it drives him along !

T
THE Dinner-bell Bogey’s good-tempered though queer ;
His aspect is strange, but there’s nothing to fear.
He climbs Squidger trees, and the clang of his bell
To Bogeys the moment for feeding should tell.
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
The moment for feeding should tell !
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
The moment for feeding should tell !

T
THE Flageolet Bogey when wishing to play
Arranges himself in a curious way.
But his phrasing and tone are so very complete
That all Bogeys are ravished, and utter, "How sweet!"
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
Are ravished, and utter, "How sweet!"
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ' Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
Are ravished, and utter, "How sweet!"

T
THE Humming-top Bogey revolves on one toe,
And wears a tight frock made of best calico.
It is printed with sharps to agree with his wings,
And the sounds of the sibilant scales that he sings.
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
The sibilant scales that he sings!
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
The sibilant scales that he sings !

T
THE Ill-favoured Bogey belabours his gong,
Keeping time with his feet as he marches along.
He bangs with his tail the Gong over his head,
When the Dinner-bell Bogey is seedy in bed.
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
The Dinner-bell Bogey’s in bed !
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
The Dinner-bell Bogey’s in bed !

T
THE Jubilee Bogey breathes hard in his horn,
Not caring a straw that his boots are so worn.
It adds to his grace that lie’s somewhat awry,
And possesses a quaver instead of an eye.
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee
A quaver instead of an eye !
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee
A quaver instead of an eye !

T
THE Kettle-drum Bogey jogs over the ground
With a “rub-a-dub-dub,”—an inspiriting sound.
But whether his arms or his tails beat the blows
Is the thing which all Bogeys say nobody knows.
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
All Bogeys say nobody knows !
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
All Bogeys say nobody knows !

T
THE Lyrical Bogey’s a talented elf,
Who arranges weird tunes as he steadies himself
With a wonderful presence of mind on the rails,
Composing, the while, with his tongue and his tails.
Ha ! Ha !- -Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
The while, with his tongue and his tails !
Ha ! Ha !- -Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
The while, with his tongue and his tails !

T
THE Natural Bogey o’erleaps a high hill,
Like those singular folk that Sir John Maundevile
Declares that he saw, who had only one foot;
See his Book, where your artist a drawing has put.
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
Your artist a drawing has put !
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
Your artist a drawing has put !

T
THE Overture Bogey just dotes on a skip,
Hopping over each bar with a flexuous hip.
While the crotchets stream forth from the ends of his hair:
'Op. 1 Giocoso's his favorite air.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
'Op. 1 Giocoso's his favorite air.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !

T
THE Poly-chord Bogey performs on three strings,
And plays hard arrangements of intricate things.
A violoncello grows out of his face,
And his legs make the music, with infinite grace.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
Make music with infinate grace!
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
Make music with infinate grace!

T
THE Quavery Bogey intones in his throat
Serenades to the moon, which are all on one note.
It seems at first sight that this cannot be true,
But Bogeys attain what no human can do.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
Attain what no humans can do!
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
Attain what no humans can do!

T
THE Rattle-tailed Bogey is eager to fly
When the weather is fine, and rotates in the sky.
Whiole the rattle revolves at the end of his tail,
With a whizz that would soften the heart of a whale.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
The heart of an obdurate whale !
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
The heart of an obdurate whale !

T
THE Six-legged Bogey is dreadfully deaf,
But he stands near the rails and concocts a base clef
With his tail and two crotchets which wave on his head.
These are black, but the rest of his person is red.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
The rest of his person is red!
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
The rest of his person is red!

T
THE Trom-bony Bogey is terribly thin,
And his instrucment slides in the bones of his chin.
Should you hear its terrific and deafening blare,
You will know all at once what it is to be there.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
At once what it is to be there!
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
At once what it is to be there!

T
THE Un-musical Bogey* thinks much of himself;
'Tis pity he hasn't been put on the shelf.
His voice is so gruesome, so awful so vile,
That when Bogeys are round, you may hear them revile.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
When round, you may hear them revile!
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
When round, you may hear them revile!

T
THE Violin Bogey is stylish and bland,
Each province of music is at his command.
Sonatas, Concertos, in fact what you please,
He can play all the lot with the greatest of ease.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
The lot with the greatest of ease!
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
The lot with the greatest of ease!

T
THE Yesterday Bogey (so called from her trick
Of never regarding the beat of the stick),
Can sing quite in tune, but when ten bars behind,
A Bogey conductor is somewhat unkind.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
A Bogey conductor's unkind !
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
A Bogey conductor's unkind !

T
THE Zig-zag-gy Bogey curvets in one boot,
Pressing out a wild air to a ear-splitting hoot.
A long Concertina's his body, you see,
An instrucment Bogeys entitle Sqeegee
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
All Bogeys entitle Sqeegee !
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
All Bogeys entitle Sqeegee !

T
THIS Blinky-eyed Bogey is no nightingale;
His voice has gone—crack !—so instead with his tail
He plays on the Cymbals—clong clangy, clung cling !—
As relished by Bogeys unable to sing.
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
By Bogeys unable to sing !
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
By Bogeys unable to sing !

T
THIS Elegant Bogey can warble a tune
With a voice that will carry from here to the moon.
Some Bogeys consider the twist of her tail
Has something to do with the powerful wail.
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
To do with the powerful wail !
Ha ! Ha 1—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
To do with the powerful wail !

T
THIS Garrulous Bogey, whose voice never tires,
Ingeniously stands near the telegraph wires;
And twirling his tail to the curves of a clef,
Sings louder—crescendo,—and louder,—-ff !
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
Crescendo,—and louder,—ff !
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
Crescendo,—and louder,—ff !

T
THIS Monkish old Bogey blows hard in his Flute,
And the cloisters re-echo the sibilant toot.
Philactery-wise on his cloak there is writ
The tune in Plain-Song which he strives to emit.
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo !—Hee ! Hee !
Plain-Song which he strives to emit !
Ha ! Ha !—Hoo ! Hoo '—Hee ! Hee
Plain-Song which he strives to emit !

NONSENSE RHYMES

T
The Weep-Minim Bogey is flooded with tears,
And howls with emotion whenever he hears
Any songs of his youth which recall by their notes
Those far away days when he sowed his wild oats.
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
Those days when he sowed his wild oats!
Ha ! Ha!-Hoo !-Hee ! Hee !
Those days when he sowed his wild oats!
