Woodleigh Hubbard was born into a playful and loving family of five children. Her kind and understanding parents encouraged her to be curious about the world around her. At the age of twenty, she was restless and so she set off on a journey around the world. She zealously studied art at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington, D.C., the School of Visual Arts in New York and the Academy of Beaux Arts in Paris, and her work has appeared in many group shows here and abroad. Not at all xenophobic, Ms. Hubbard has lived in both the U.S. (eight states in all) and France. This is the first book she's written and illustrated for children, but she's eager to do more. Ms. Hubbard is now happily residing in Maryland.
