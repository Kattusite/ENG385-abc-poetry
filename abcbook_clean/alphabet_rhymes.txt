Never heard!

B
B is for Bench—
Some place to sit;
Where children play
And mothers knit.

C
C is for Cook,
Simmer and boil—
When the meal’s eaten,
What’s left of the toil?

D
D is for Dawn
On the tail of night.
If you yawn,
You haven’t slept right.

E
E is for Eat—
All salads and greens.
And remember to skip
The in-betweens.

F
F is for Fair—
Be honest and just.
If you don’t think you can,
Then you really must!

G
G is for Game,
When the work is done.
If you play it all day,
It’s no longer fun.

H
H is for Hop—
Like a furry rabbit.
It’s fun for a time,
But a horrible habit!

I
I is for Ice—
In cream and in box;
Also for Icebergs
Which look more like rocks

J
J is for Jack,
And the house that he built;
And also for Jill,
And the water she spilt.

K
K, of course, is Kangaroo,
Who sits on his tail
The whole day through;
But then, he has nothing
Better to do.

L
L is for Law—
Rules to obey.
Whatever is done,
Must be done the right way.

M
M is for Mule—
Stubborn and strong.
It has to be prodded
To move along.

N
N is for Nothing—
Nothing at all.
You can’t pick it up,
And you can’t let it fall.

O
O is for Oak,
A beautiful tree.
You find it wherever
Acorns may be.

P
P is for Pen—
Dip it in ink;
Cover the page
With whatever you think.

Q
Q is for Quack
From the ducks in the pond.
When one begins,
The others respond.

R
R is for Rain,
Cold and wet.
If you don’t wear rubbers
What a cold you get!

S
S is for Sea—
Its waves and its swell.
The fishes live in it,
They like it so well.

T
T is for Train—
Wherever you are,
You always can take one
And go quite far.

U
U is for Us—
No matter how many.
It’s better at that,
Than not being any.

V
V is for Vine,
Climbing the wall;
As old as the house,
It grows just as tall.

W
W is the World,
Round as an O.
It turns on its axis,
Above and below.

X
X is for Xmas—
The day of good cheer.
No matter what happens
It soon will be here.

Y
Y is for Youth—
The bud on the bough;
The time of life
For the enjoyment of now.

Z
Z is for Zoo—
A wonderful place,
Where man and beast
Come face to face.
