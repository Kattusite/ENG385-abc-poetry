And caught only a frog.

With ten or twelve apples
All piled up on high.

KEY TO THE
NURSERY RHYME ALPHABET.
The child should be required to name the objects in this Alphabet, without seeing the Kay; which can be referred to, if necessary. By this means a knowledge of objects, and the amusement of using his own observations, will be obtained.

L
L is a Lark,
Who sings us a song,
And wakes us betimes
Lest we sleep too long.
