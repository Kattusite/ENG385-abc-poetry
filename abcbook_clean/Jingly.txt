A LITTLE GIRL

A
A handsomely illustrated
collection of simple musical
rhymes, in Waltz, Polka,
Mazurka, March and other

A
A little girl had a little curl, in the middle of her forehead;
And when she was good, she was very, very good,
but when bad she acted horrid,
And when she was good, she was very, very good,
but when bad, she acted horrid.

B
BABY BOY
Baby boy, his Papa’s joy, Mamma’s only treasure,
Always doing what he’s told,
Never naughty, rude or bold, Papa loves his baby boy,
Loves him beyond measure.
Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Baby boy, Papa’s joy,
Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Papa’s Baby Boy.

C
CATCH ME LITTLE ONE
Catch me, little one, come I pray,
Let us dance, Let us play,
God and hide, we’ll play Peek a Boo,
All the live-long day; ….
One, two, three; Now catch me,
Come, my little one, play with me;
Have no fear, Mamma’s near,
She will watch o’er Thee and guide Thee.

D
DEAREST, SWEETEST, BABY, SLEEP.
Dearest, sweetest, Baby my darling one, sleep,…
Close your eyelids, Mamma will watch o’er you keep,…
Softly slumber, Sandman will soon come around,..
And all sweet babies, they must asleep then be found,….
Bye, bye, Bye, bye; Hush little one, don’t you cry,…
Bye, bye, Bye, bye,; Mamma sings your Lull-a-by…

E
EYES SO BRIGHT, LIKE STARS AT NIGHT
Eyes so bright, like stars at night,
Two rosy lips and likewise dimpled chin,
Golden hair, and cheeks so fair,
No sweeter baby’s ever been;
Come, climb on Mamma’s knee,
Be good as you can be,
Papa’s gone to build a cottage,
For you and me.

F
FAR AWAY, FAR AWAY
Far away, Far away,
No one’s ever been there,
Way down, ‘neath the town,
No one’s ever been there;
That’s where Mister Bogey-man,
Goes around a prowling,
Down the chimney windy nights,
You can hear him howling.

G
GO AWAY, RAINY WEATHER
Go away, go away,
Nasty rainy weather,
Want to wear my Sunday hat,
With a nice new feather,
Rainy man, my hat you’d spoil,
And down my hair of gold run,
I can’t go to Sunday School,
Unless I wear my old one.

H
HONG KONG, DINGLE DONG
Hong Kong, Dingle Dong,
That’s a place in China,
Over seas and over trees,
Over Asia Minor,
Chinaman he comes from there,
With his pigtail funny,
Turn in toes, washes clothes
Makee lots of money.

I
IN A SHOE A LITTLE MOUSE
In a shoe a little mouse,
Built a little nest.
Raised a little family,
Fed them on the best...
Man picked up the shoe to wear,
Taken down a peg,
When he got his foot inside,
The mice ran up his leg...

J
JOHNNY WOULD A SOLDIER BE
Johnny would a soldier be,
Fighting for his own country,
But when John was asked to fight,
He cried and ran with all his might,
Johnny would a sailor be,
Sailing on the deep blue sea,
But he wouldn’t learn to swim,
And so that was the end of him.

K
KITTIE KITTENS, PRETTY KIT
Kitty Kittens, pretty Kit,
Tabby, sandy gray,
Where is our Canary gone,
Won’t you tell me, pray?
Kittens hung their little heads,
Sitting in a row.
Licked their mouths and winked their eyes,
And said they didn’t know.

L
LAZY BOY, LAZY BOY
Lazy boy, lazy boy,
Never goes to school,
If he does he falls asleep,
Perched upon a stool,
Never learned to read or write,
Never does his sums,
All the work he ever does,
Is twiddling his thumbs.

M
MARY ANN, MARY ANN
Mary Ann, Mary Ann,
Way across the seas she ran,
Over hill and dale she flew,
Till she got to Timbuctoo.

N
NANNIE, THAT’S OUR LITTLE GOAT
Nannie, that’s our little goat,
Funny things go down her throat,
Eats up papers, cans and glass,
And won’t touch hay or nice green grass.
Fire cracker too she ate,
Thought she’d die as sure as fate,
Nannie smiled as they went off,
Saying, oh what a nasty cough.

O
OH MY, LITTLE FLY
Oh, my, little fly,
Mother’s sugar stealing,
Walk around, upside down,
On the parlor ceiling,
And when baby goes to sleep,
And to bed we take her,
You tickle both her noes and toes,
And naughty fly you wake her.

P
PAPA IS COMING HOME
Papa is coming home,
Let’s go out to meet him;
Run down to the garden gate,
Ready there to greet him,
Picks us up and carries us,
Jim and John and Mandy,
Then he turns his pockets out,
Gives us lots of candy.

Q
QUEER THINGS, QUEER THINGS
Queer things! queer things! little boys are ‘fraid of,
Bullfrogs and puppy dogs, little boys are made of.
Bad boys, made a noise, their folks, they wouldn’t mind ‘em,
Bogie man swallowed them, nobody can find ‘em.

R
ROUND ABOUT, ROUND ABOUT
Round about, round about,
Round the chimney corner,
Telling lots of fairy tales,
Playing Johnny Horner,
Brownies, Goblins, Gnomes and things,
Giants too, and elves,
Things that swallow other things,
Then swallow up themselves.

S
SARAH JANE, SARAH JANE
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Started in a crying,
Ev’rybody thought that she
Surely must be dying.
Sarah Jane was put to bed,
Now wasn’t it just shocking,
For pins and needles by the score,
Were sticking in her stocking.

T
TOMMY, TOMMY WENT TO FISH
Tommy, Tommy went to fish,
In a pool of water,
Tommy’s Papa looked for him,
With his little daughter,
Soon they caught a little fish,
Took it home and fried it,
When they cut it open,
Tom was fast asleep inside it.

U
UPIDEE, UPIDEE
Upidee, upidee,
Born with eyes and then can’t see
Born with tail and then can’t swim,
Upidee, upidee,
How I pity him.

V
VIC, VIC, CUNNING VIC
Vic, Vic, Cunning Vic,
That’s my little dog,
Oh she feels so very sick,
he’s just like a log,
Someone comes into the room,
Suddenly says “Rats,”
And then she’s just as full of life,
as forty dozen cats.

W
WILLIE, WILLIE, OH SO SILLY
Willie, Willie, oh so silly,
Found a big cigar,
Hid from sight, got a light,
Bad boy,—yes, you are,
Took a puff, that’s enough,
Any boy to kill,
They had to call the Doctor in
because it made him ill.

W
Words by Charles Noel Douglas,
Music by the late Richard Stahl,
composer of “Said Pasha” and
other operas, and George Rosey,
composer of the famous “Honeymoon
March,” etc.

X
XTRA, XTRA, LITTLE BOYS
Xtra, xtra, little boys,
Hear them loudly shout,
Go and buy a paper dear,
See what it’s about,
Ragged boy, told a fib,
Jane the paper read,
And not a single word it had,
Of what that bad boy said.

Y
YOU KNOW WHO I LOVE.
You know, you know who I love,
Baby Phyllis mine,
Let your little chubby arms,
‘Round my neck entwine,
That’s a pet, now Papa’s watch,
He will let you hold,
If you drop it on the floor,
Papa’s bound to scold.

Z
ZEBRA, ZEBRA, FUNNY THING
Zebra, Zebra, funny thing,
Stripes upon his coat.
Rings of black now look and see,
On body, legs and throat;
Tommy’s got a pot of paint,
Naughty little brat,
And tried to make a Zebra
out of his Tom Cat
