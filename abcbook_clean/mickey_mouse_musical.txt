His BANJO Donald Duck tunes up
Just watch his happy face

C
Mickey as CONDUCTOR
Waves his baton up and down

D
And Horace bangs upon the DRUM
He's heard throughout the town

E
The Monkey Clown's EUPHONIUM
Accompanies a song

F
And Clarabelle picks up her FLUTE
And tootles loud and long

Don Pedro sings a serenade
While playing the GUITAR

Upon the HORN blows Peter Pig
And makes more noise by far

HELLO CHILDREN, girls and boys,
This is Mickey Mouse,
Bringing with a merry noise
Music to your house
If you listen you will hear
The latest compositions;
See pictures full of happy cheer,
Of twenty-six musicians.
Under my conducting hand
Playing any song;
The A.B.C. symphony band
Never can go wrong.
My introduction has been said,
But now there’s more to see;
So read right through from A to Z
The musical A.B.C.

I
The Goof tries out two INSTRUMENTS
That's really rather queer

J
When Mickey plays some special JAZZ
The others start to cheer

K
M'Bonga beats the KETTLE-DRUM
He likes its rattling noise

L
While on the LYRE Clara Cluck
A tender tune enjoys

M
Pluto's always useful
His tail's a MUSIC-STAND

M
MICKEY, driving down the road,
Was hauling a tremendous load
Of horns and drums and other things,
Let’s hear what his announcement brings.

N
He listens to the splendid NOISE
Made by the Babies-band

O
Old Grandpa plays the ORGAN
But the wind blows off his hat

P
While Mickey at the PIANO
Hits every sharp and flat

Q
Then four of Mickey's clever band
All sing in a QUARTETTE

R
Till the babies with the RATTLES
The music sweet upset

S
The Dippy Dogs blow SAXOPHONES
A long and joyful note

S
SO-LONG, Children!
A-B-C ing you
again shortly!

By Gideon the Goat

The thin grasshopper plays

A merry tune to blow

Run gaily to and fro

In tune with all the rest

The whole band plays with ZEST
